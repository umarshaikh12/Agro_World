            <h2>Avocado</h2>
            <p>avocado, (Persea americana), also called alligator pear, tree of the family Lauraceae and its edible fruit. Avocados are native to the Western Hemisphere from Mexico south to the Andean regions and are widely grown in warm climates. Avocado fruits have greenish or yellowish flesh with a buttery consistency and a rich nutty flavour. They are often eaten in salads, and in many parts of the world they are eaten as a dessert. Mashed avocado is the principal ingredient of guacamole, a characteristic saucelike condiment in Mexican cuisine. Avocados provide thiamin, riboflavin, and vitamin A, and in some varieties the flesh contains as much as 25 percent unsaturated oil.</p>
            <h3>Major Types</h3>
            <p>Horticulturally, avocados are divided into the Mexican (Persea americana, variety drymifolia), West Indian (P. americana, variety americana), and Guatemalan (P. americana, variety guatemalensis) races, with more than 1,000 cultivars between them. The Mexican race is native to Mexico and is characterized by the anise-like odour of the leaves and by small (weighing 90–240 grams [3–8 ounces]), thin-skinned fruits of rich flavour and excellent quality. Mexican avocados are the hardiest, growing in regions too cold for other types. The Guatemalan race, native to the highlands of Central America, is slightly less frost-resistant than the Mexican and produces fruits of medium to large size (240–1,000 grams), characterized by thick woody skins and a ripening season different from that of the others. Cultivation of the West Indian race, the most tropical in character, is limited in the United States to southern Florida. Hass avocado, the most popular cultivar in the United States, is a Mexican-Guatemalan hybrid.</p>
