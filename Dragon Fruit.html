            <h2>Dragon Fruit</h2>
            <p>The Dragon Fruit is a tropical, perennial, epiphytic, vine-like cacti fruit tree that belongs to the Cactaceae family. This climbing cactus has triangular, green stems (up to 6 m or 20 feet long) and is mainly propagated with cuttings, but seeds can also be used.

                The flowers are hermaphrodites (have both female and male reproductive organs), but some varieties require cross-pollination to form fruits.
                
                They bloom only at night and only for one night; hence the plant is sometimes also called “moonflower” or “lady of the night“. They are bell-shaped, white, and large (20-36 cm or -14 inches long and 23 cm or 9 inches wide). The pitahaya plant can have between 4 to 6 fruiting cycles annually, depending on the variety and the environmental conditions.</p>
            <h3>Dragon Fruit Colors</h3>
            <p>Dragon Fruit flesh can range from white (white, pink, yellow, or orange skin) to hot pink or deep purple with tiny black seeds. The color of the flesh determines the flavor. For example, whitish dragon fruits can have a mild taste, and darker flesh can be sweeter and juicer.</p>
